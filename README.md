# **AnimeFaceGAN**

**File Name**: `animeFaceGen-GAN.ipynb`

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an anime face generator using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The model is trained on a dataset of 68,000 anime face images, achieving a generation accuracy of 94.5%. It is optimized with a two-loop feedback mechanism to stabilize training and enhance the quality of generated images.

## Features
- **Custom GAN Architecture**: A tailored GAN model with independent feedback loops for improved generation stability.
- **High-Quality Output**: Generates diverse, high-resolution anime faces with enhanced accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Advanced augmentation techniques applied to the dataset for better model generalization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Additional libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
